Coordinate generation, so it belongs to the conformation stage. Kept apart
from ``manager.py`` because that stage reads and rewrites a LAMMPS data file,
while these are plain geometry: give them two junctions and a bead count and
they hand back a path.

    """A random walk of fixed bond length that lands exactly on ``end``.

    Every step is drawn from the cone of directions that still leaves the far
    junction reachable in the bonds remaining, so the walk closes on it
    without any bond being rescaled afterwards. Returns ``n_bonds + 1``
    points.

    This is the shape a chain in a melt actually has, and the difference from
    a straight line is not cosmetic. A straight chain lies on its chord, so
    whether two chains meet is decided by where their crosslinks sit; a
    coiled one wanders, and chains whose crosslinks are far apart routinely
    run alongside each other while nearest neighbours by crosslink may never
    touch. Anything that needs to know which chains are near which -- the
    entanglement candidate ranking, for one -- needs the coiled shape.

    The walk is unbiased only in the limit of plenty of slack. As the chain
    approaches full extension the reachable cone narrows to nothing and the
    path straightens, which is correct: there is only one way to span a chord
    of ``n_bonds * bond``.
